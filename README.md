# MASTERINGJAVA100 — My Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the **Mastering Java 100+** practice problems.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open it in **IntelliJ IDEA**
3. Run any problem class from `src/` (each solution includes a `main` method)

## Structure
- Solutions are organized by problem number under `src/`
- Each problem is self-contained and runnable on its own

## Notes
These are my own implementations for learning and practice. Expect occasional refactors as I improve readability and Java fundamentals.
